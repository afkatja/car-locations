# Car locations

## Rationale
The app is set up using React Create App and basic redux setup for fetching data from the API. I resolved to using React Router to render cities list, locations list and the cars list.

## View the app
The app is deployed on Netlify. Visit carlocations.netlify.com to view it.

## Setting up to run locally
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm i` in the root dir
- run `yarn start` and see the app at `http://localhost:3000`
